Share the code and data of the peoposed mothed in the manuscirpt named "Temperature-Field Enhanced LSTM-Based Thermal Error Model and Digital Twin Application for Motorized Spindle"
## TemperatureFieldModeling
The code and data in the modeling of the thermal-network-based temperature field model.
## ThermalErrorModeling
The code and data in the modeling of the temperature-field enhanced LSTM-based thermal error model. The accuracy and robustness of the proposed temperature-field enhanced LSTM-based (TF-LSTM) thermal error modeling method are also verified by a six-fold cross-validation with the comparison of other modeling methods.
